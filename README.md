**Purpose**: This repository is a guide to help build your intuitions and give you a foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms.  This guide provides walkthroughs for 60+ problems that demonstrate the most common patterns you're going to need to solve new interview questions you've never encountered before.

**Approach**: Every day, you will have a set of problems to attempt. After you've made an honest attempt at the problem, you'll watch the video walkthrough included with the question.  As you watch these video walkthroughs, pay attention to the pattern that's being demonstrated and try to generalize it to other problems.  This guide includes write-ups that will point out these connections to you but you should be looking for them on your own as well.

On a weekly basis, this should be your workflow:

`Attempt problem --> Readings and Videos teach you the optimized approach/pattern (take notes) --> Think about how you can generalize this approach to other problems --> Code the approach that you learned from the video --> Attempt next problem`

Every day you'll have around 4 problems to work through
