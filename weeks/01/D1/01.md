Today is the first day of your journey to proficiency in data structures and algorithms.  This week is going to cover arrays & graphs/trees.

## Two Number Sum (from algoexpert.io)
â€‹
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in sorted order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. Assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.

```JavaScript
function twoNumberSum(array, targetSum) {
  // Write your code here.
  console.log(array + targetSum)
}
```

### Hint 1
Realize that for every number X in the input array, you are essentially trying to find a corresponding number Y such that X + Y = targetSum. With two variables in this equation known to you, it shouldn't be hard to solve for Y.

### Hint 2
Try storing every number in a hash table, solving the equation mentioned in Hint #2 for every number, and checking if the Y that you find is stored in the hash table. What are the time and space implications of this approach?

### Hint 3
What if we sorted the array?  Could we make one pass over the sorted array using 1 or more pointers to come to an answer?

## Solution

Solution 1 - with a hashmap
```JavaScript
// O(n) time | O(n) space
function twoNumberSum(array, targetSum) {
  const nums = {};
  for (const num of array) {
    const potentialMatch = targetSum - num;
    if (potentialMatch in nums) {
      return [potentialMatch, num].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    } else {
      nums[num] = true;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```

Solution 2 - sorting with two pointers
```JavaScript
// O(nlog(n)) | O(1) space
function twoNumberSum(array, targetSum) {
  array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let left = 0;
  let right = array.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = array[left] + array[right];
    if (currentSum === targetSum) {
      return [array[left], array[right]];
    } else if (currentSum < targetSum) {
      left++;
    } else if (currentSum > targetSum) {
      right--;
    }
  }
  return [];
}
```
